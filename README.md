### Learning NextJS

I wasn't able to create-next-app with npx, so I tried npm which didn't work too, finally I install yarn and used npx again (FIXED)

<code> npm install --global yarn </code>

<code> npx create-next-app project-name </code>

<pre>
  <code>
  
    yarn dev
      Starts the development server.

    yarn build
      Builds the app for production.

    yarn start
      Runs the built app in production mode.
      
  </code>
</pre>
